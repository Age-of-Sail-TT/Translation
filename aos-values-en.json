         "$aos_guide_contents": "Welcome to Age of Sail, this is Hadestia the CEO of Age of Sail will teach some guide on how this gamemode works.\n  \n» The Game\n• The plugin disabled other inbuilt content and other local plugins to avoid ruining this mode and how its works, however we can't disable plugins downloaded from plugins store so it's all visible that you can use anytime, but please stay with the old times theme of the plugin tnx. :)\n• We only used the TheoTown API to create this gamemode and so there are some bugs that can't be fix.\n• Functions of the plugin are only works within this map, you can't do same things outside of this.\n• Updates & changelogs can be seen on \"News\" (the floating date UI), you can look up them there.\n• All buildings associated with this plugin are all inside the \"AoS\" category.\n• Necessary news headlines associated on the plugin are highly chosen, other clarification specially for dates you can touch us on our discord server.\n\n» You may still notice some ingame notification wanting you to declare zone for RCI, I'd recommend not to use them to avoid ruining the theme of the game.\n\n» Settings\n• You can disable floating buildings icons and other settings related to the plugin, These are all located at the game setting then \"Plugins\".\n\n» Government Buildings\n• Town hall - Town Hall set as the police department on game which spawn police officers that patrol on your town. Townhall is the most important building here, you can access panels by clicking and almost buildings are require this building.\n• Military & Maritime school - The only school here.\n• Market/Mercado - Market allows you sell and buy wares when needed. Market will let you buy 30 pieces each ware, but set amount requirements for selling.\n\n» Supply \n• Aos do not much use of supply buildings, RCI's and some other buildings only requires water to work, The Well is the only water supply (located in Government category) that used radius (not pipes) on supplying.\n\n» Production Buildings\n• Forge - Forge uses x2 iron for making cannonballs and produce 10 cannonballs and gunpowder each building.\n• Lumbering - Lumbering produce 20 planks each building that used for building purposes.\n• Mining - Mine produce 20 iron used for making cannonballs.\n• Plot of spices - Produce 200grams of spices each tile.\n• Plot of sugar - Produce 200pieces of sugarcane each tile.\n• Spice farmhouse - Spice farmhouse collects spices from farm and produce sack of spices depending of grams you had, 1kg. of spice consists of 1000grams.\n• Sugar farmhouse - Sugar farmhouse collects sugarcane from farm that later hold by Mill.\n• Mill - Mills sugarcanes to make sugar depending of the amount of sugarcane you had, 1000sugarcanes is equivalent to 1kg of sugar.\n\n» Ware Production\n• Production buildings produce their wares that takes place every half of month(AOS date), You can also viewed overall productions by interacting with the Town hall.\n\n» Enemy spawner and enemies\n• Enemies take place every year and start once you reach Town lvl 5, depending on its probability, spawner can spawned up to 5 ships. Enemy ships will find their way to get closer on your town and spawn enemy troops once they reach the land. be sure you had enough defenses and ammo to clear the wave. \n\n» Defenses\n• Defense buildings had an important role on your town, Defense buildings helps you defend your town from enemies. Defense buildings (specially had guns) are loaded with gunpowder and cannonballs. Artillery is the most powerful defense that can detect enemies up to 25 tiles around. Fortress with cannons are more accurate with 0.5 ratio unlike Artillery has 0.4. Gunpowder traps are also powerful which can blast enemies around it.\n\n» Flags national\n• National flags can be flown only by joining with the desire nation, click the town flag and tap join. National flag can only set one time only, you're not able to change them after joining.\n\n» Earning gold coins - an easy manner to earn more gold.\n• Buy cargo at cheap prices and sell them at expensive prices, These are highlighted by viewing inflation tab located by tapping the town hall.\n• Searching for wrecks gives you fair enough of gold.\n• Smugglers can pay +20 more gold for each cargo than on its actual price.\n• Docked merchant ships would give you 100 coins for docking.\n• Hunting a treasure chest on treasure Island would give you lots of coins.\n• Building income ships.\n• Controlling RCI's taxes.\n\n» Exchange of goods\n• Trading post will let you access merchant ships that may want to enter your town, You can exchange cargo with them depending on what cargo they want to exchange, click trading post and allow merchant ship to dock.\n\n» Reputation\n• Reputation had an important role for building RCIs and even for visitor ships. Fooling, deporting smugglers and staying merchant ships for long time can decrease nation's reputation depending of what nationality they had. Keeping a good manner and trading with them will increase reputation. Low reputations can lead of small income when selling cargo at them and can even lock some buildings.\n• You may see reputation tab by interacting with the town hall.\n\n» Ships\n• You build ships by building and interacting with the shipyard.\n\n» Blueprints\n• Available ships on shipyard needs a full 100% blueprint, which you can obtain part of it by searching wrecks.\n\n» Waste disposal\n• Farm tile such as spice and sugarcane also provide 10 aspect for waste disposal needs to grow crops healthy.\n\n»ONLINE REGION\n• Soon....\n\n» DISCORD SERVER\n• You can join, give feedback and participate on and see our latest updates and announcements regarding for Age of Sail.
